## Kata Instructions

* All kata requirements do not need to be coded in order for the kata to be submitted, however requirements implemented 
  should be done so using best practices.
* This is a showcase of skill,not speed.
* All code should be test-driven and committed.

## Setup & Requirements

* Have an IDE of your choice ready 
* Download & [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* Downlad [Java 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
